# DLML

This repository contains GANs implemented in Python. Click on the links below to see the videos. They are located in the examples/ folder in this repo.

## Training

Shows the development of constant latent vectors throughout the training process.

## Interpolation Between two Points in Latent Space

Shows morphing of one image into another by interpolating between two points in the latent space z.

## Travel Through Tatent Space

Shows travel through latent space. The 'traveler' does not take sharp turns and does not exceed the bounds of the data distribution of z.
